# SimpleAi

A library to train and run Neural Networks on CPU using vectorization and as many optimizations as I can be bothered to implement.

This is most definitely **NOT PRODUCTION READY NOR WILL IT EVER BE**. If you want to actually create and run neural networks, use something like ML.NET, PyTorch or any other reputable AI library.

Was made while watching [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/@SebastianLague)'s "[How to Create a Neural Network (and Train it to Identify Doodles)](https://youtu.be/hfMk-kjRv4c)" video and implementing my own optimizations on top of it.
